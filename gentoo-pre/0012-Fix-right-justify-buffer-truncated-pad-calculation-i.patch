Subject: [PATCH 12/45] Fix right justify buffer-truncated pad calculation in
 mutt_FormatString()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Vincent LefÃ¨vre noted that the computation had implementation defined
behavior and was potentially incorrect.

Change to make sure the subtraction won't lead to a wrap-around, and
set pad to 0 in that case.
