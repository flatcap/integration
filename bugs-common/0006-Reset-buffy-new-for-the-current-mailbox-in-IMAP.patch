Subject: [PATCH 6/6] Reset buffy->new for the current mailbox in IMAP.

1f840760e6e0 moved the buffy->new reset inside the STATUS processor.
Since the current mailbox is not STATUS'ed, it needs to be reset in
imap_buffy_check().

Thanks to Aaron Schrab for reporting this issue (and for helping test
tip).
